### Nature Gifs

* I created an app with gifs about nature
* I started by creating an array of things in nature
* When a button is clicked, 10 giphy images are displayed
* You can click on the images to display a moving image of Nature
* You can click the image again to stop the movement in the image
* You can add new buttons of Nature images with gifs on the right of the page
* Enjoy the gifs!!
